Ever since the dawn of the human race we have looked to the stars. For millennia we have attempted to 
understand the vast universe around us. Famous philosophers like Aristotle have theorized how the universe 
works. Yet all of us have done this from the same place, on the Earth. But humanityâ€™s fascination with the 
unknown is what drives us to go further than ever before. Now with the technology at hand, we no longer have 
to look upwards, now we can travel into the stars, gaining a different perspective and knowledge of the universe 
around us. Our goal is to help humanity achieve this by partnering with other space companies to make humanity an 
interplanetary species.
